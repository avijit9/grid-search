## Using Grid Search to improve Machine Learning models

### Description

In this project, we'll fit a decision tree model to some sample data. This initial model will overfit heavily. Then we'll use Grid Search to find better parameters for this model, to reduce the overfitting.

### Install

This project needs  **Python 3.7** and the following Python libraries should be installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

### Code

Template code is provided in the notebook `grid-search.ipynb` notebook file.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `grid-search/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
jupyter notebook grid-search.ipynb
```
or
```bash
ipython notebook grid-search.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your web browser.

### Data

The dataset used in this project is included as `data.csv`.
